<p>For my Environmental photomontage i chose the topic of global warming/ melting glaciers causing polar bears to lose their home. 
  I use 3 layers for the background, the original background, the line of fire and an iceberg that i a copy of an iceberg 
  i masked from the orginal bacckground which i overlayed with where it would be originally over the fire. I used a a transparent gradient on a polar bear to show that it's in water.

  For Social I chose privacy as my topic. I show that my displaying a giant eye over phone users, as many things we do on our phones are not
  completely private due to cookies as well as just us posting anything.
