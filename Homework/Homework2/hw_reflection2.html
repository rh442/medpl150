<h1>Homework 2 Reflection</h1>


<p>
    This homework was overall rather enjoyable, even with my unfamiliarity with the tools. I had some issues operating
    the DSLR cameras. I wasn't sure what all the settings did and didn't understand why some clicks didn't capture the 
    photo. It also took me until my final picture to realize i can zoom in. In the end I took a total of 5-6 pictures and 
    the only ones that I liked were the ones I chose for the Homework.

    The photoshop side of things were slightly better as the linkedin Learning videos helped me navigate photoshop. However
    I still have issues with some things such as buttons that are in different locations the ones in the video. I also encounter
    some issues while editing imageA where when i made the image too dark the light on the left side would also become red, which
    i didn't want and looked unnatural. In the end I settled with having the image lighter so the light doesn't shine red. If I had more
    time I would like to learn to resolve that issue.
