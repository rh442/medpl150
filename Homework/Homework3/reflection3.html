<h1>Reflection 3</h1>

<p>
  For this assignment I struggled the most with taking the pictures. There were some pictures that i tried to get that didn't have 
  take a picture of, but camera didn't focus the way i wanted it to. I changed the focus area but the pictures weren't coming out like it
  did with the water bottles. every thing in the picture was still relative clear and not blurred.

  I found it interesting that we can use raw file in photoshop to fix any crookedness, leveling the image, as well as edit the exposure.
  original image looked like it was taken in a dark hallway while the edit one looks like it was taken in a brighter hallway.
