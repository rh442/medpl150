<p>For my Environemntal Photomontage I created a bindle in AI and brought it to PS. 
   This is to show that the polar bears are losing their homes and are force to move.
   For this vector i had some trouble with the repeat pattern with the polkadots as they weren't aligning 
    to how I wanted  it to look

  For the Social, I was disatified with the eye I had so I created new eyes in AI. I used pathfinder divide to cut the eye,
  and added opacity the binary in the background of my PS would show in the eyes.
