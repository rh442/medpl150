<img src="../../images/Hw7.png" width=800px>

<p>I chose the image because i believe the look down the street from the Hunter Bridge is a great view. 
  In my homework I included the bridge itself as a frame for the foreground of the image. 
  For the colors, particularly the purple i chosen a 4th color from the triad option so i can differentiate buildings from one another in the midground.
