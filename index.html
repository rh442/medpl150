    <h1>Raymond Huang's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I am a CS major who is exploring the media major. I am hoping to use media classes
        to help me improve web design skills,make my websites better and more user 
        friendly by learning design skills. I want to learn design skills so i can improve the 
        the visuals of websites as well as create images through media tools like photoshop if neccessary. 
    </p>  
      <br>
    <p>
        My goal is to create visually appealing websites, as i don't have much of an eye for this. 
        I would also like to create short and simple webgames like wordle and connection from New York times.
        These short,simple and yet addictives games are my current goal, as they are visually appealing games
        that improves the user experience, causing them to return more often as oppose to webgames with only text,
        and little to no design.
