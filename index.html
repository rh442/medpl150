    <h1>Raymond Huang's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Raymond Huang I am a CS major who is exploring the media major. I am interested in web development.
        I enjoy web dev as I get to see my code come to life as I work on it. I am interested in web games like wordle 
        and connection, hope to create web games similar to that. These simple and addictive webgames are my current goal.

        I don't have much experience with the design part itself. My current way of working on design would be using 
        colors related to topic such as when such as using green and brown for a page on climate change. When my design 
        choice does not origin from color symbolismm/association it usually come from books or movies.

       In Medpl 150 my goal is to learn design skill so that future webpages that I created will be visually appealing.
      I would like to learn basic design skills and work with tools that could help enhance web development such as photoshop 
      for images that I may need but can't find online.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        I had little issues when setting up the site. The main issue was when i first initialized the repository i had set it to
        private so i couldn't access pages. I then i has to find how to set the repo to public. In the course i hope to learn how
        to structure pages so that they look visually appealing.
