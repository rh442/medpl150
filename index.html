    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I am a CS major who is exploring the media major. I am hoping to use media classes
        to help me improve web design skills and make my websites better and more user 
        friendly.  I want to learn design skills so i can improve the the visuals of websites 
        as well as create images through media tools like photoshop if neccessary. My goal is 
        to create visually appealing websites. I would also like to create short and simple webgames
        like wordle and connection from New York times.
