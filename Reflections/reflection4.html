  I found the interactivity of this article interesting. Aside from the regular behavior of the article moving up as you scroll through, there are also images that cycle through as you scroll.  One section is a comic like you scroll with text and slightly animated images, the images and play / cycle when you scroll. There were also little animations that played when you scrolled on the graphical image in the latter half of the article. This interactivity made the article more interesting visually for the reader who’s reading the article. It brings life into the typical black and white article, causing the reader to be more invested.

  I found it interesting on how this was implemented, as certain sections respond to the typical scroll behavior. Instead of moving the page down, they respond to the scroll by proceeding with an animation, as if it was a slide show with words flying into view as well as images cycling through, following the narrative. Further, one section with the 4 images has only the related image highlighted as you scroll, highlighting a new image as the text changed and dimming the old one.

	While I found little interest in the article itself, the interactivity of the article made it more fun. Colors and animation hooked my attention, as well as surprised me since i was expecting a plain old article.
