<h1>Reflection 1</h1>
<p>
  	I agree with the author that photography seems like magic. With one click of a button you can freeze and capture a moment in time. And through many tools we can alter the size of this picture / moment in time. As stated by the author, photographers see photography less as an art but more as a culture / ritual. Parents would take pictures of their children throughout their life from the first steps to graduation and to weddings. Taking pictures is less of an art to most people and more of preservation of memory/ Tourist take pictures so they would remember their trip when they return.  Aside from memories, photographs also serve as important information. They can serve as proof in a police investigation. They can also help you locate where to go by giving you a visual of your destination.  

	While there are several positives of photography, there are also several negatives such as invasion of privacy. As the author states " To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed". In this way, photography can become a tool for blackmail. The author often compares the camera to good, and I found that to be a good comparison as while a camera can be used to protect yourself such video proof of where you were at the time of a crime. In the wrong hands it can be used for blackmail. This is much like how the gun can be used for self-defense or in the wrong hands, murder. 

	I also found it interesting that cameras can also serve the opposite purpose of guns. The author talks of how the gun safari in East Africa has seen an increasing shift from gun to film for “shooting” the animals. The guns' purpose to kill and the films, purpose is to protect them. I also found it interesting that photographer's intention can change the output of the photo so they can turn ugly work into beautiful and a beautiful subject grotesque. 

	Nowadays many things use photography from basic arts to advertisements. Photos are in our everyday life, and they can help with our everyday life. Things like google maps can help give us an idea of what building we need to look for when we go to a new place. Using photography companies can advertise their products. Photography has become a staple of everyday life as images are more attention grabbing than basic words.
