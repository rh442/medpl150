    The illustration allows a quicker setting of the environment as opposed to text. We can see what the 
    environment is like in seconds as opposed to a paragraph dedicated to declaring the environment. The images allow
    us to see what things actually look like as an illustrator can sometimes be inaccurate.

    The advantage of illustration over text as stated above is that it depicts information quicker than text. Text can be 
    lengthy while describing a scenario but an illustration can get that scenario across in seconds.

    The advantage of illustration over photography is that illustration allows for the portrayal of a past event, somemthing
    photography can't do. Photography can only portray the present or or planned future event. Illustration can portray anything.
    From past to future, illustration is limited to the real world.

    In "Memunatu: The distant patient‘Birth in my village’", The events prior to the nurses meeting Memunata could not be photographed, illustration
    and first-hand account from Memunata were required to depicts the events that happened during this time. After going to the centre we see
    photographs of the centre and medical equipment. Only events starting from the centre were photographed as cameras were present at that time and place.
    There were no cameras at the village and when Memunata gave birth, cameras cannot depict what's not directly in front of them. Therefore
    these scenes can only be depicted visually through illustration as no cameras were present.
