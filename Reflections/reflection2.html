  I believe that the author is right regarding AI slop being somewhat of an echo chamber reinforcing ideas of a group. They use these generative AI to reinforce their ideas, and since “Generative AI is trained on pre-existing data, which research has shown is inherently biased against ethnic diversity, progressive gender roles and sexual orientations...”, those biased thinking are common in AI. Furthermore, with these AI images and videos everywhere in media, those that are not media literate will easily believe these thinking that their beliefs were right.

  As an audience often think of these as just content and think nothing much of it, but i can see how some ppl may be desensitized due to the content of some of these Generative AIs. Unlike younger generations, the older generations may have a hard time differentiating Generative Ai and reality, so they will be more gullible to information spread through this form of media.

  In general, I feel like most AI slop is easy to distinguish from real media, but generative AI has been getting better and harder to distinguish. I have seen some generative AI that puts well known media figures together to do podcasts and subjects you learn in school. Such as Calculus and chemistry. When I first saw this, it looked realistic and believable. At the same time, it may be helpful as you can look at Generative AI and learn at the same time, as kids may have an easier time learning if they are looking at a figure they know talking about math.

  Personally, I haven’t been exposed to much political Generative AI aside from the obvious fake ones of conversations between Joe Biden and Barack Obama. But there are several times I was fooled by Generative AI. In the video from afar it looks like there were several peaches, both as the camera zoomed in it is revealed that those ‘peaches’ were hamsters. I see many AIs of this format another being fried chicken into puppies
